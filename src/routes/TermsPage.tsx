          The short version: PaperWing is a free reader for the open web, run as a small independent project. Use it in good faith, respect the networks it connects you to, and understand it comes as
          it is. By using PaperWing you agree to these terms and to the{' '}
          <Link to="/privacy" className={link}>
            privacy page
          </Link>
          .
        </p>

        <Part title="What PaperWing is">
          <p>
            PaperWing gathers stories and discussions from other places (Hacker News, Lobsters, Lemmy, Bluesky, Mastodon, PeerTube, Pixelfed, and the sites and feeds you follow) and lets you read,
            save and join in. It doesn’t host those networks or their content, and it isn’t affiliated with any of them.
          </p>
          <p>It’s free, it’s new, and it will change: features may be added, changed or removed, and it may be unavailable at times.</p>
        </Part>

        <Part title="Other people’s content">
          <p>
            The image viewer can save pictures to your device where the image host allows it. Downloading a picture does not transfer its copyright or permission to reuse it. If a host blocks the
            download, you can open the original instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            Discourse forums and Standard.site publications are read from their public feeds or records. Following them here does not sign you in to those services or publish a subscription there. The
            publications in New on the open web are found automatically, not chosen or reviewed by us: being listed isn’t an endorsement.
          </p>
          <p>
            WARN notices in the Layoffs topic are public records, restated from each state’s own list, which can lag, change or contain mistakes; the state’s list is the record. Open roles under Still
            hiring are read from the employer’s own job board a few times a day and may be out of date. PaperWing isn’t a jobs service: applications go to the employer, through its board.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stories, articles, posts and comments belong to the people and publishers who made them. PaperWing shows headlines, excerpts, public posts, pictures and links, and the reader view and
            saved stories fetch an article for your own reading, the way your browser would. Follow the link to the original to support the people who wrote it.
          </p>

            </a>{' '}
            and it will be dealt with promptly.
          </p>
        </Part>

        <Part title="What you post">
          <p>
            Copying or sending a topic or feed link does not publish a post. Anyone receiving the link can open it; personal feeds show each recipient’s own version, and a mix needs to be published
            before its public page can be shared.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shared links can display previews using public names, descriptions, profile banners, avatars or community artwork from their sources. Those assets remain their owners’ content and subject
            to the source’s terms. Messaging and social services may cache previews, so changes or removal at the source may take time to appear there.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anything you post, reply, vote on or share from PaperWing goes to the network you chose (Bluesky, Mastodon, Hacker News, Lemmy) under your own account, and that network’s terms and rules
            apply to it. It’s yours, and you’re responsible for it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Listing a story on PaperWing</strong> publishes a public Bluesky post and a small public record in your Bluesky account. They can be seen and copied by anyone, like any Bluesky
            post, and you can delete them on Bluesky.
          </p>
          <p>While signed in with Bluesky, an upvote on someone else’s PaperWing listing is also a public Bluesky like. Taking it back removes the like. Downvotes only affect your own ranking.</p>
        </Part>

        <Part title="Using it fairly">
          <p>Don’t use PaperWing to:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc space-y-1 pl-5">
            <li>spam, harass or deceive people, or post anything illegal;</li>
            <li>overload, scrape or attack PaperWing or the networks it reads, or get around its limits;</li>
            <li>sign in to accounts that aren’t yours, or break the rules of the networks you use through it.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            PaperWing’s front page, boards and Bluesky feeds are shared spaces. Listings that are spam, abusive or illegal, or that a network’s own moderation has labelled, can be left off them, and
            so can the accounts behind them. That only affects PaperWing’s pages: your Bluesky post stays yours.
          </p>
          <p>
            Posts you write here can be edited, and an edited post says so. For a day after an edit, what it said before stays readable on PaperWing. Edits made within a minute of each other may show
            as one.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Community boards</strong> are run by the people who start them. Their owners and moderators set their rules, can hide listings from their board and keep accounts out of it, and are
            responsible for how they moderate, including whether only they can post there. Their moderation follows their board’s listings onto the front page. PaperWing’s own rules still apply on
            every board.
          </p>
          <p>
            Boards marked <strong>Official</strong> are run by PaperWing. Only their moderators post there, and that’s where PaperWing’s announcements come from. A board that only calls itself
            official in its name isn’t.
          </p>
        </Part>

        <Part title="Your accounts on other networks">
          <p>
            You sign in to other networks at your own choice, and your use of them is between you and them. Hacker News has no sign-in for apps, so PaperWing signs in on your behalf with the details
            you give it (see the privacy page for how). Any network can change or block that kind of access at any time, and PaperWing can’t promise it will keep working.
          </p>
        </Part>

        <Part title="AI summaries">
          <p>
            Summaries use your own Anthropic API key, on your Anthropic account, under Anthropic’s terms, and you pay Anthropic for them. They’re written by an AI from the discussion and can be wrong
            or miss the point: read the thread before relying on one.
          </p>
        </Part>

        <Part title="Your data and sync">
          <p>
            Your library and settings live on your devices. Sync is offered as is: keep your sync code or passkey safe, because without it nobody (including us) can recover your data, and synced data
            untouched for 400 days is deleted. Export your library from Settings if it matters to you.
          </p>
        </Part>

        <Part title="No guarantees">
          <p>
            PaperWing is provided as is, without warranties of any kind, to the extent the law allows. To the extent the law allows, its makers aren’t liable for losses from using it, or from not
            being able to: lost saved stories, a missed notification, something a summary got wrong, or anything another network or website does. None of this limits rights you have under consumer law
            that can’t be excluded.
          </p>
        </Part>

        <Part title="Changes and questions">
